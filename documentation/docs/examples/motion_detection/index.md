# Motion Detection

Detect motion using a simple PIR Sensor. 

```yaml
--8<-- "examples/motion_detection/raspberry.yml"
```


You can combine this with the [screen on/off example](../screen_on_off/index.md) to turn the screen on when motion is detected and off after a timeout. Look at the [automatic screen power control](../automatic_screen_power_control/index.md) on how to set it up.
